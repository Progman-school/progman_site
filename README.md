## About
**[ProgMan site](https://progman.site)** is a website side of the volunteer project to promote the IT & programming culture to aspiring, juniors and just usual people to learn it.
Doing this as my free time hobby.

### The website description
The absolutely custom web fullstack project built from scratch. It has a few functions invented by my own ideas and the students requests.
It is used along with an additional AdminPanel project, but works independently as a separate microservice using the same database.
>#### Functional stuff of the website
>- Pass-through multi-language translation tags feature
>- Telegram registration through a custom bot
>- E-mail registration with the address confirmation
>- User requests management using Telegram Bot API
>- Certificate serial numbers checking for the learners
>- The emergency support widget across the website
>- The courses study program counter, using the carousel slider ant the interactive test page.
>- The test build feature, to create any tests quickly for the automatic user training.
>- Coupon discount system for the paid services.
>- Database re-builder - The old DB to new one *(feature was required after a significant change in the OOP model and database structure to preserve an existed data)*
