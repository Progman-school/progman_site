### About the project 
**ProgMan school** is my side educational project to mentor/train the programming junior and aspiring developers in my free time, as a hobby.

### The website description
The absolutely custom web fullstack project built from scratch. It has a few functions invented by my own ideas and the students requests.
It is used along with an additional AdminPanel project, but works independently as a separate microservice using the same database.

#### Functional stuff of the website
- Pass-through multi-language translation
- Telegram registration through a custom bot
- E-mail registration with the address confirmation
- User requests management using Telegram Bot API
- Certificate checking for the graduated students
- Fast support widget across the website
- The courses program preview, using the carousel slider ant the interactive test page.
- The info and contacts pages
- Database re-builder - The old DB to new one (feature has been required after a significant change in the OOP model and database structure to preserve an existed data)

### The used technologies
#### Backend:
- Laravel (PHP framework)
- MySQL database
#### Frontend:
- Vue.js (JavaScript framework)
- Templates using HTML 5 and CSS 3.0
#### Deployment
- GidHub Actions
- AWS cloud (EC2, Elastic Beanstalk)
- Nginx webserver configuration (also works with Apache)
